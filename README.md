# ***In Development***
# Faulty-Node-Analysis
## Project done for Computer Networking Class
### Project Description

We will be doing our project on dynamic routing mechanism design in a faulty network. We will compare different protocols and how they adapt to a faulty node based on the throughput, loss, and delay of each when simulated.
